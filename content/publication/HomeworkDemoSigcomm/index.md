abstract: |
The Homework project has examined redesign of existing home network infrastructures to better support the needs and requirements of actual home users. Integrating results from several ethnographic studies, we have designed and built a home networking platform providing detailed per-flow measurement and management capabilities supporting several novel management interfaces. This demo specifically shows these new visualization and control interfaces (1), and describes the broader benefits of taking an integrated view of the networking infrastructure, realised through our router's augmented measurement and control APIs (2).Aspects of this work have been published\: the Homework Database in Internet Management (IM) 2011 [3] and implications of the ethnographic results are to appear at the SIGCOMM W-MUST workshop 2011 [2]. Separate, more detailed expositions of the interface elements and system performance and implications are currently under submission at other venues. A partial code release is already available and we anticipate fuller public beta release by Q4 2011
