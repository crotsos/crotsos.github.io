TOUCAN aims to achieve ultimate network convergence, enabled by a radically new technology agnostic architecture targeting a wide range of applications and end users. This architecture will facilitate optimal interconnection of any network technology domains, networked devices and data sets with high flexibility, resource and energy efficiency.

TOUCAN will revolutionise the way we build and operate communication networks in a similar way that computer networks and, more recently, mobile terminals were transformed from platform-oriented to platform-agnostic solutions (e.g. through Linux and Android), and will drive towards commoditisation of network devices. Any new technology generation, regardless whether wired or wireless, will connect to the TOUCAN network in a plug-and-play fashion.
