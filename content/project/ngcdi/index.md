Network providers are predicting a huge growth in new services and applications, with tens of billions of devices, sensors, vehicles, and people becoming interconnected over the next 10 to 15 years. All of this will place unprecedented demand on the underlying infrastructure. Traditionally, the deployment of new services has involved reinvestment in infrastructure, extensive pre-testing, and people-intensive service support in operation, requiring several hundred people to deliver. However, future services will change ever more rapidly - and unpredictably - and therefore organizations need to drastically reduce the time it takes for new services to be developed, trialed, and launched. This requires radical improvements in the agility and responsiveness of the network infrastructure itself: the infrastructure will need to support near-real-time monitoring of performance, self-diagnose problem states, and enable rapid and informed human intervention when needed. The ambition is to reduce service costs as well as providing a framework to spin out innovation in days rather than years. The core infrastructure will not only provide huge capital and operational cost savings, significant in itself, but also greater growth potential, since the cost of innovation and experimentation will be reduced and its speed increased.

To address these challenges a new industry-academic partnership, Next Generation Converged Digital Infrastructure (NG-CDI), is creating a vision for the building and operation of a future-proof network infrastructure and its autonomic management. Such an infrastructure must be capable of fast and efficient service innovation and co-creation with a wide variety of customers. NG-CDI promises completely new ways of operating the infrastructure. Recent advances in programmable network interfaces and model-driven networking provide the possibility of closed-loop, self-optimizing, and self-healing operations. NG-CDI builds on these breakthroughs to deliver greater economies and customer value. Operating changes of this scale need not only radical technological solutions, but also changes to the organization itself.
